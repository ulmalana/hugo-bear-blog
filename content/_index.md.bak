Before joining IRIS cluster, I worked as an IT solutions engineer at [RML](https://rml.co.id), focusing on cybersecurity solutions.

<!-- Computer networking has been my passion and I love learning new things. I spend my spare time programming in Clojure and put the code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ulmalana) account. -->

<!-- I am open to job opportunities as software engineer/developer. You may reach me at `muhamaul[at]gmail.com`. -->
