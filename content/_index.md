### I am Riz Maulana (莫拉那)

I am currently working as an IT solutions engineer at [RML](https://rml.co.id). Before that, I was a Master\'s student at [CSIE NCU](https://www.csie.ncu.edu.tw/), Taiwan. Before enrolling at NCU, I received my Bachelor\'s degree from Department of Informatics, [Universitas Brawijaya](https://www.ub.ac.id), Indonesia.


Computer networking has been my passion and I love learning new things. I spend my spare time programming in Clojure and put the code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ulmalana) account.

I am open to job opportunities as software engineer/developer. You may reach me at `muhamaul[at]gmail.com`.
