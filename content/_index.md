### I am Riz Maulana (莫拉那)

I am currently working as an IT solutions engineer at [RML](https://rml.co.id). Before that, I was a Master\'s student at [CSIE NCU](https://www.csie.ncu.edu.tw/), Taiwan. Before enrolling at NCU, I received my Bachelor\'s degree from Department of Informatics, [Universitas Brawijaya](https://www.ub.ac.id), Indonesia.


I love learning new things. Computer networking has been my passion and currently I am learning functional programming as well.
